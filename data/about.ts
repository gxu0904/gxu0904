I'm a technologist and student passionate about building systems that connect engineering, business, and design. I enjoy creating tools that scale impact—whether that's automating logistics, improving access to education, or developing intelligent robotics systems.

At Valley Christian High School, I lead initiatives that merge innovation with execution. From co-founding StudyAP, an AI-powered learning platform reaching thousands of students, to serving as CTO at LightAid, a nonprofit combating global light and learning poverty, I focus on turning ideas into sustainable, data-driven outcomes.

I'm especially interested in exploring projects that bridge technology and human impact—where algorithms meet empathy and design drives accessibility.
