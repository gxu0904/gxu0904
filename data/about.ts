I'm a software engineer and builder driven by curiosity and impact. I love creating systems that turn complexity into clarity—whether that's scaling nonprofits, optimizing workflows, or designing tools that make learning more accessible.

As someone who thrives at the intersection of technology, business, and community, I’ve led projects that blend engineering precision with entrepreneurial vision. From developing AI-driven learning tools to automating event logistics for hundreds of students, I enjoy transforming ideas into tangible results that empower others.

Currently exploring opportunities at the intersection of computer science, business, and research, where I can build products that bridge innovation and human connection.
